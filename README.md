# 🍔 Wordware Magic: Snap & Get Recipes! 🍳

💥 Cook Up Recipes in a Flash with Wordware.ai 🚀
You might have seen people uploading photos and generating recipes or uploading a picture of a math problem on AI and getting step-by-step solutions. It needs a little bit of coding.
With **Wordware.ai** we can do that within 2 minutes. Recently, I have been trying Wordware and it's amazing. The first time it took time for me to understand and once you get it, you can develop an application within 2 minutes. Here, I've attached the step-by-step guide for creating minor projects on wordware.ai.

### ⚙️ Getting Started

1. **Sign in to Wordware.ai 🔑**

     🚀 Head over to [Wordware.ai](https://www.wordware.ai/) and log in to get started!

3. **Create a Flow:**

      Tap Create a New Flow to begin the magic, Name it, and set the input type (Image/Text/File/Audio – whatever works for you). 🖼️🎤

 4. The most important and easiest task, add ai generation ( placeholder to add LLM completion). The AI is like your head chef - tell it exactly what to do! 👨‍🍳✨

5. **Deploy the application:**

      Upload your pic, hit the button, and let the AI work its magic. 🔄📸
