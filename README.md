# 🍔 Wordware Magic: Snap & Get Recipes! 🍳

💥 Cook Up Recipes in a Flash with Wordware.ai 🚀
You might have seen people uploading photos and generating recipes or uploading a picture of a math problem on AI and getting step-by-step solutions. It needs a little bit of coding.
With **Wordware.ai** we can do that within 2 minutes. Recently, I have been trying Wordware and it's amazing. The first time it took time for me to understand and once you get it, you can develop an application within 2 minutes. Here, I've attached the step-by-step guide for creating minor projects on wordware.ai.
